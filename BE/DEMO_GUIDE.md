# ðŸŽ¯ Demo Guide - Team Todo Management System

## ðŸ“‹ Demo Overview

This guide demonstrates a **new user experience** scenario where a fresh user (David) joins an existing team and collaborates with existing members (Sam) through real-time features and AI-powered task management.

## ðŸŽª Demo Flow: New User Experience (20-25 minutes)

### ðŸŽ¯ **Demo Scenario: David joins Sam's team**
**Objective**: Demonstrate how a new user (David) registers, gets invited to an existing team, receives task assignments, and collaborates with team members through real-time features and AI assistance.

### ðŸŸ© **Step 1: Sam's Existing Team (2 minutes)**
**Sam (existing user) logs in and shows his team setup**

```bash
# 1. Sam logs in (existing user from seed data)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "sam@example.com",
    "password": "password123"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "user-id",
    "email": "sam@example.com",
    "firstName": "Sam",
    "lastName": "Jose"
  },
  "access_token": "jwt-token-here"
}
```

```bash
# 2. Sam views his existing teams
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/teams/my-teams \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer SAM_JWT_TOKEN"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "team-id",
    "name": "Development Team",
    "description": "Main development team for the project",
    "owner": { "id": "sam-id", "email": "sam@example.com" },
    "members": [

      { "id": "jane-id", "email": "jane@example.com" }
    ]
  }
]
```

```bash
# 3. Sam views existing todos in his team
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/todos/team/TEAM_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer SAM_JWT_TOKEN"
```

**Key Points to Highlight:**
- âœ… Sam has existing team with members
- âœ… Team has existing todos
- âœ… Real-time WebSocket connection ready

### ðŸŸ« **Step 8: Real-time Collaboration Demo (3 minutes)**
**Sam sees David's new task in real-time via WebSocket**

**WebSocket Connection Setup:**
```javascript
// Sam's browser connects to WebSocket
const socket = io('http://localhost:3000');

// Sam joins his team room
socket.emit('join-team', { teamId: 'TEAM_ID' });

// Sam listens for real-time updates
socket.on('todo-created', (todo) => {
  console.log('New todo created:', todo);
  // Update UI to show new task
});

socket.on('todo-updated', (todo) => {
  console.log('Todo updated:', todo);
  // Update UI to reflect changes
});
```

**Real-time Test Scenarios:**

```bash
# 1. David updates task status
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/todos/TODO_ID/status/in_progress \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer DAVID_JWT_TOKEN"
```

```bash
# 2. David assigns task to different team member
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/todos/TODO_ID/assign/JANE_USER_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer DAVID_JWT_TOKEN"
```

**Expected Real-time Events:**
```javascript
// Sam receives these events instantly:
{
  "type": "todo-status-changed",
  "data": {
    "id": "todo-id",
    "status": "IN_PROGRESS",
    "updatedBy": "david@example.com"
  }
}

{
  "type": "todo-assigned",
  "data": {
    "id": "todo-id",
    "assigneeId": "jane-user-id",
    "assignee": { "email": "jane@example.com" }
  }
}
```

**Key Points to Highlight:**
- âœ… Instant real-time updates across all team members
- âœ… WebSocket room management for team isolation
