## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **1. Real-time Notifications Not Working**
- **Check**: WebSocket connection status in browser console
- **Solution**: Ensure backend WebSocket server is running
- **Verify**: Network tab shows WebSocket connection

#### **2. User Registration Fails**
- **Check**: Backend API is accessible
- **Solution**: Verify backend server is running on port 3000
- **Test**: `curl http://localhost:3000/health`

#### **3. Team Creation Issues**
- **Check**: User is properly authenticated
- **Solution**: Clear browser cache and re-login
- **Verify**: JWT token is valid in browser storage

#### **4. Real-time Updates Not Syncing**
- **Check**: Both browsers are on same domain
- **Solution**: Use same browser type for demo
- **Verify**: WebSocket rooms are properly joined

### **Debug Commands**
```bash
# Check backend health
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Check frontend build
npm run build

# Check for TypeScript errors
npm run type-check
```
